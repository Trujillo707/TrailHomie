# TrailHomie 
Cal Poly Humboldt 2024 Hackathon Entry by the Percolators

TrailHomie is a mobile application designed for Humboldt County hikers and bikers.
Users can quickly see the current status of popular trails and just as easily send reports of their own.

## Technical Information
This project was developed on the Android Studio IDE in the Kotlin language. We used the Jetpack Compose toolkit for the User Interface.
The database for this software is provided by Firebase in the form of their Firestore cloud database.

~~ ## Note: Took the database down since I don't want to forget about it and accidently get charged some day

I would take very little time to connect it back up, the fundamental code works even if the database is empty ~~

Database is online for now. End of life unknown.
